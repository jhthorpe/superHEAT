    ## Molecule Archive
    Core functionality:
        * Molecular feature space, identifiers, and ID
        * Molecular geometry name: xyz coordinates in Bohr
        * Each unique geometry forms a secondary identifier 
        * Notes on each molecule   
        * Storage and Retrieval in archive
        * Add and remove data from calculations for a given geometry
        * Geometry dependent features (force constants, population analysis, HOMO-LUMO gap, etc)
    
    ### Molecular Feature Space
        * Internal name
        * charge, multiplicity
        * number of electrons, number of core electrons, number of valance electrons
        * atom counts
        * Bonding list 
        * Smiles string, ATcT ID
    
    ## Calculation Archive
    Each calculation must have reference to the following:
        * The molecule/geometry at which it was performed (molecular identifiers)
        * The quantum chemistry program used
        * The output file from the program (Does this need to be separate from the repo?) 
        * The constants used
        * The basis set(s) used on each atom (orbital, RI, JKFit) 
        * The output value 

    ## Constants Archive
    Need to record the values used for constants at any given time. Since each program might have it's own 
    set of constants, we need to name these and declare which we are using at any point. Note that the atomic units are "fixed"
    and are the unit of choice here. Each constants set needs
        * Name
        * Date
        * Universal constants 
        * atomic masses and isotope masses
        * uncertaines?
