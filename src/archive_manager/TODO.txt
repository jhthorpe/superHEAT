TODO:
* Git Functionality
* Install Functionality
* Molecule archive
* Calculation archive 
* Basis Set archive
* Constants archive 
* Model Chemistry module
* ATcT Interface
* Statistics package  

## Git Functionality
The archive MUST be zipped prior to push/pull
Add archive to .gitignore just in case

## Install functionality
Unzip and place the 


## Molecule Archive
Core functionality:
    * Molecular feature space, identifiers, and ID
    * Molecular geometry name: xyz coordinates in Bohr, internal coordinates in Bohr, Angle, Diheydral
    * Each unique geometry forms a seconrdary identifier 
    * Notes on each molecule   
    * Storage and Retrieval in archive
    * Add and remove data from calculations for a given geometry
    * Geometry dependent features (force constants, population analysis, HOMO-LUMO gap, etc)

### Molecular Feature Space
    * Internal name
    * charge, multiplicity
    * number of electrons, number of core electrons, number of valance electrons
    * atom counts
    * Bonding list 
    * Smiles string, ATcT ID

## Calculation Archive
Each calculation must have reference to the following:
    * The molecule/geometry at which it was performed (molecular identifiers)
    * The quantum chemistry program used
    * The output file from the program (Does this need to be separate from the repo?) 
    * The constants used
    * The basis set(s) used on each atom (orbital, RI, JKFit) 
    * The output value
